IBMÂ® App Connect Enterprise combines the existing industry-trusted IBM Integration Bus (IIB) technologies with IBM App Connect Professional and with new cloud native technologies, to deliver a platform that supports the full breadth of integration needs across a modern digital enterprise.

Using the App Connect Toolkit, you can develop integration solutions and deploy them to the dedicated runtime of IBM App Connect Enterprise and to App Connect on IBM Cloud. You can use an extensive range of administration and systems management options to manage your integration solutions. 

# Introduction

This chart deploys a single IBM App Connect Enterprise for Developers integration node into an IBM Cloud Private or other Kubernetes environment.

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `rel1`:

```bash
helm install --name rel1 ace11-dev --set license=accept
```

This command accepts the [IBM App Connect Enterprise for Developers license](LICENSE) and deploys an App Connect Enterprise for Developers server on the IBM Cloud Private cluster. The [configuration](#configuration) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

> **Tip**: See all the resources deployed by the chart using `kubectl get all -l release=rel1`

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `rel1` release:

```bash
helm delete rel1
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart.

## Configuration
The following table lists the configurable parameters of the `ace11-dev` chart and their default values.
